**To run this application, you must have Java 8 installed.**

### Using the application
To try and test the application, simply open a terminal in the `climate-change-vis` folder and run the command `java -jar climate-change-vis-app.jar`

### Running the project in IntelliJ IDEA

To access the code and run it yourself in IntelliJ IDEA, take the following steps:
- Right click the climate-change-vis folder and click **Open Folder as IntelliJ IDEA Project**. Alternatively, with IntelliJ IDEA open, click `File > New > Project From existing Sources` and select the `climate-change-vis` folder. Leave all the other settings as they are to create the project.
- After the project is created, go to `File > Project Structure > Project` and set the **Project SDK** to **1.8**
- Set the **Project language level** to **8 - Lambdas, type annotations etc.**
- Set the **Project complier output** to a new folder `climate-change-vis > out`.
- Add JUnit as a Project Library. Still inside the **Project Structure** menu, navigate to **Libraries** and click **+** and select **From Maven**. In the dialog that appears, write *"org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.4.2"* in the search bar and press **OK**. Apply the changes and close the Project Structure menu 
- From the project file list, right click the `src` folder and press `Mark Directory as > Source Root`. Mark `resources` as the `Resource Root` folder and `test` as the `Test Root` folder the same way.
- Finally, run the main method by opening the `climate-change-vis > src > aib > Main` file and then clicking `Run > Run... > Main > Run` from the application bar.

## Libraries
#### [FastNoise by Jordan Peck](https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoise_Java)
Library used to generate noise values from my samples. I replaced javax.vecmath.Vector2f and javax.vecmath.Vector3f with com.sun.javafx.geom.Vec2f and com.sun.javafx.geom.Vec3f because javax is no longer part of Java and I already use JavaFX.\
*The class is included in my project structure, so you do not need to add it in.

#### [ZoomableScrollPane by Daniel HÃ¡ri](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44314455)
Replacement for the JavaFX ScrollPane, for the added functionality of zooming.Used as a container for the map, so it can be zoomed in on.\
*The class is included in my project structure, so you do not need to add it in.

#### JUnit 5
Used for unit testing.\
*Instructions for how to add the Library to the project are detailed in the [Running the project in IntelliJ IDEA](#Running the project in IntelliJ IDEA) section.
